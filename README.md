# Visual Studio For Windows Code Snippets #

This is simply personal collection of custom snippets I have created to make my life a little bit easier when working in Visual Studio 2019 for Windows. I'm primarily using [VS4Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) these days, so this collection is a bit smaller than [that one](https://github.com/jbachelor/VisualStudioForMacSnippets).

### Adding Snippets to Visual Studio For Windows
Microsoft has some nice documentation on creating and adding snippets. Look for the heading, ["To Add a Code Snippet to Visual Studio"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-creating-a-code-snippet?view=vs-2019).
